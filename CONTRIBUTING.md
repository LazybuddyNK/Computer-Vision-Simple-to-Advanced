Hello surfer, welcome aboard! Are you looking for sharing some cool algorithims or your own approach to solve some Computer Vision Project?

## Rules
* Use only your own code and if you are borrowing other's code then give credits on some section.
* Clearly explain working mechanism of your code.
* Try to show demo of your system so that we can review it faster.
* Share your work!
